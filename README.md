## Getting Started with NumPy
NumPy is a vast library with a wide range of functions, methods, and variables. Here's a list of some of the most commonly used ones, categorized by their purpose:

## Array Creation Functions:
- numpy.array(): Create an array from a list or iterable.
- numpy.zeros(): Create an array of zeros.
- numpy.ones(): Create an array of ones.
- numpy.empty(): Create an empty array without initializing values.
- numpy.arange(): Create an array with regularly spaced values.
- numpy.linspace(): Create an array with evenly spaced values.
- numpy.eye(): Create an identity matrix.
- numpy.random.rand(): Generate random numbers from a uniform distribution.
- numpy.random.randint(): Generate random integers within a specified range.
- numpy.random.normal(): Generate random numbers from a normal distribution.

## Array Attributes:
- ndarray.shape: Get the dimensions of the array.
- ndarray.dtype: Get the data type of elements in the array.
- ndarray.size: Get the total number of elements in the array.

## Array Manipulation Functions:
- ndarray.reshape(): Reshape the array.
- numpy.concatenate(): Concatenate arrays.
- numpy.vstack(): Stack arrays vertically.
- numpy.hstack(): Stack arrays horizontally.
- numpy.split(): Split an array into multiple sub-arrays.

## Indexing and Slicing:
- Indexing: Access elements using square brackets and indices.
- Slicing: Extract portions of an array using colons.

## Array Operations:
- Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, **, etc.
- numpy.sum(): Sum of array elements.
- numpy.mean(): Mean of array elements.
- numpy.max(): Maximum value in the array.
- numpy.min(): Minimum value in the array.

## Broadcasting:
- Perform operations on arrays with different shapes following broadcasting rules.

## Universal Functions (ufuncs):
- numpy.sin(): Sine function.
- numpy.cos(): Cosine function.
- numpy.exp(): Exponential function.
- numpy.log(): Natural logarithm.

## Random Number Generation:
- numpy.random.seed(): Set the seed for random number generation (for reproducibility).
- numpy.random.choice(): Generate random samples from an array.
- numpy.random.shuffle(): Shuffle the elements of an array in place.

## Aggregation and Reduction:
- numpy.sum(): Sum of array elements.
- numpy.mean(): Mean of array elements.
- numpy.median(): Median of array elements.
- numpy.std(): Standard deviation.
- numpy.var(): Variance.
- numpy.argmax(): Index of the maximum value.
- numpy.argmin(): Index of the minimum value.

## File I/O:
- numpy.save(): Save an array to a binary file.
- numpy.load(): Load an array from a binary file.
- numpy.savetxt(): Save an array to a text file (e.g., CSV).
- numpy.loadtxt(): Load an array from a text file.

## Linear Algebra:
- numpy.dot(): Matrix multiplication.
- numpy.transpose(): Transpose a matrix or array.
- numpy.linalg.eig(): Eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- numpy.linalg.solve(): Solve linear equations.

This is not an exhaustive list, but it covers the most common functions, methods, and variables used in NumPy. As you continue to work with NumPy, you may encounter many more specialized functions and methods for various data manipulation and analysis tasks.
